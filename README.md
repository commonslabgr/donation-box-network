# gsoc17-donationbox

[View the project on Google Summer of Code website.](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5171214440988672)

## Synopsis
The main purpose of the project is to modernize the so called donation boxes, to keep pace in the new digital era.
This will achieve by implementing all the necessary infrastructure to create ultimately a decentralized (_from specific donations boxes_) network, where all donation boxes are interconnected and can be managed from a central node. <br>
Doing the **modern** donation box, actually.
