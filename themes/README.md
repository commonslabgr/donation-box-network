This is our own custom theme, which is used for the final appearance of the pages from the donation projects, **in the donation boxes**.
Because is provided to the user when creating a new donation project the ability to preview his appearance, to knows how it will look in the donation box. What will be the user experience.

But this theme require ( because it is based on it ) to install on Wordpress the [Influence Wordpress theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/influence/).

So first, install the Influence theme and after that just drop on the wordpress installation directory <br>
( ```wordpress/wp-content/themes``` ) , all this directory.

After that, your themes directory will have the following format :
```
wordpress/wp-content/themes
                        |
                        ├── influence
                        ├── influence-child
                        ├── twentyfifteen
                        ├── twentyseventeen
                        └── twentysixteen
```
**You don't need to activate the Influence theme**, just install it on your WordPress installation.
