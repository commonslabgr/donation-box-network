# Donation-Box

This directory it contains all the necessary to operate the real donation box.
The donation box for its operation requires a set of settings and applications which in combination with each other produce the final result and the user experience that the final user will have.

This part of the whole system and network of doantion boxes which is being implemented, it is especially important to us. Because from here (from the actual donation box) everything starts. From this actual donation box, donations are made. So each one of the donaton boxes is an important active member of the donationbox system/network, in fact the most active part of the system.
Also the actual donation box is where the end user has both digital and real experience. For this reason, we are responsible to satisfy both.


## Of what it consists the actual donation box.
The final donation box will consist of the following main parts :
* Python Django WebApp : To displaying the donation projects to the end user.
* SQLite Database : For storing local data.
* OpenVPN Client : To synchronize the data safely.
