    The Donation_Project model.

    This is the base table. It contain all the information we think needs to be in the donation box for each donation
    project. This data comes directly from the remote database and updated or inserting new records only from the
    remote database (when it is possible to communicate and synchronize with it).

    Important! : This table is *not* updated *by local* data!! Its data is a small snapshot from the remote database!

    This table is mainly used for the presentation of the donation projects from the Django application.
    In the unique case that combines the data with the temporary table ("temporary_Donation_Project"), is for the total
    amount that collected for a donation project. The "current_amount" field in this table is added together with the
    sum of the "amount" field of the entries for this project, in the "temporary_Donation_Project" table (if they exist).
    Because there is a case for a donation project have been donations in this box and may not  has not been able to
    synchronize with the remote database and therefore, that this table is not fully synchronized as well.

    The beloved Django creates * automatically * and one more field named "id".

    Attention! The fields :
        - "video_URL",
        - "stylesheet_URL",
                            it may be NULL, but it must not be blank!
    That is, if it is null (empty), it means they have no value, and not how they may have a zero value ("").
